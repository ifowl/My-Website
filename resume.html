                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm an ambitious Computer Science student looking for his first opportunity to gain experience in the field.
                    I love programming, problem solving, and displaying creativity through my work. My hope is to learn from
                    other senior IT employees and build upon my current skills. I work great with others and will display
                    leadership and passion! Currently I'm teaching myself web development on top of my regular course work.

                    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">You're looking at it! This site was built from scratch in VS Code. It has advanced my experience in web design and JavaScript. On top of the
                        minimalistic design and animations, I implemented the libraries DayJS and ScrollMagic to make the website pop.</p>

                <p>I grew up running Linux Distros on my computer so I'm very comfortable with the operating system. Many of my skills are specific to Linux applications such as Gimp for image editing and Kdenlive for video editing.
                    I'm planning to learn their Windows equivalents, namely Photoshop and Davinci Resolve.

                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I learned patience and disipline while working here during my first year of college. My responsiblity was to watch over the kids attending the park and look out for their safety while enforcing rules.
                    This job taught me to stay focused, take responsiblity, and manage multiple things at once in a rather chaotic environment. I look fondly on my time here and believe it helped me mature as a person.</p>
